Skin Cancer Classification is a vital task in medical image analysis. It involves the identification and categorization of skin lesions into malignant and benign classes using machine learning techniques. By leveraging deep learning models and large-scale datasets, such as the Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign dataset, accurate classification can be achieved. This technology holds great promise for improving early detection, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of skin cancer, ultimately aiding healthcare professionals in providing timely and effective interventions.
